`binary_crossentropy` could be used for binary classification instead of `categorical_cross_entropy`.

## How to set steps_per_epoch
(I used to grid search this parameter when I didn't know what I was doing. ðŸ˜…)
- 1024 images in training directory
- loading 128 at a time (batch size)
- 1024/128 = 8 == steps_per_epoch
- Setting 8 will cover the full dataset

## How to set validation_steps
- images in validation directory = 256
- batch size = 32 
- validation_steps =  8

## Difference between multi class and multi label classification
Ref: https://gombru.github.io/2018/05/23/cross_entropy_loss/
### Multi class
3 classes trained
1 class predicted as output
Only is the prediction

### multi label
3 class trained
1,2 or 3 classes predicted at once
