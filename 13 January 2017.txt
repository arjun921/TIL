arrays in python can be done using a list.

spaced inputs can be taken by the following code:
s = input().strip().split(' ')
input format:
2 4 6 2 3 5 7 8
s = ['2','4','6','2','3','5','7','8']

printing an array without [] or ,
s = [2, 3, 4, 1]
print (s)
output:
[2, 3, 4, 1]
print (*s)
output:
2 3 4 1
